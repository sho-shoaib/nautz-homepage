# NAUTZ
#### NAUTZ is a collection 5000 different NFTs, each blended uniquely. The NFTs have been created using ERC 721A, the latest and most efficient smart contract. There will also be an additional 100 NFTs created by various traditional and digital artists, including 2D and 3D creators, painters, photographers, and musicians. Moreover, minting will be in two phases, presale (only for whitelisted wallets) and public sale, which will be for everyone.
