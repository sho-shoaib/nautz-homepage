        <p className='hover:scale-105'>
          So it all dates back to the time when the planet Cerberus, which was
          placed in the farther universe, bigger and more resourceful than
          Earth, had caught itself up in a dreadful ordeal. I know there is no
          such historic or scientific claim of such a planet because Cerberus
          swallowed itself and became a dead planet before science could recover
          it. But the only proof that remains of this mishap is the existence of
          Nautz, a group of 5000 cultured men. This group was led by my great
          grandfather Elon Tusk, to save the habitat of other planets with the
          help of their bitter experiences.
        </p>
        <p className='hover:scale-105'>
          Let's start from the start. Hundred years back the resourceful and
          rich planet of Cerberus was toppled by the radioactivity of a nuclear
          disaster that happened in Cerberus Nuclear Power Plant. The calamity
          occurred during a security test on the steam turbine of a BMRK-type
          nuclear reactor. The power went to zero, going uncontrollable and
          creating a chain reaction which produced enormous energy. The
          radioactive contamination happened because of the adverse temperature
          rise caused by global warming.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className='hover:scale-105'>
          The disaster overthrew the entire planet, and the spread of
          radioactive waves caused living and birth casualties. Water bodies
          were polluted, forests went down, and natural resources started to lay
          dead. The average life expectancy went down to the 30s, my ancestral
          stories still terrify me , how my forefathers lived young ready to
          welcome death at any time.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className='hover:scale-105'>
          However, few people managed to survive a little longer by taking
          iodine tablets that reduced the effect of radioactivity by 70â„…. Along
          with the few who survived was my grandfather, Elon Tusk who flocked a
          group of flamboyant young men from outer universes who were well
          acquainted with aeronautical evolution and were sensitive towards
          sustainability.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className='hover:scale-105'>
          These men were a perfect blend of science and nature. My grandfather
          Elon and the Nautz were a great devotee of science and knew how to
          forge aircrafts and had cracked the code to travel to an infinite
          number of realities, planets and dimensions through portals. After
          encountering the living horrors of Cerberus, they first started with
          their Earth voyage to educate people for using environment-friendly
          and less planet-destructive tools in order to progress.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className='hover:scale-105'>
          The Nautz introduced a new vision to all of them, how they aimed to
          sustain nature by stimulating scientific growth and striving to lift
          the ethics of space and aeronautical studies. The Nautz soon realised
          how passionate the people of Earth were to make their dreams reach
          outer space but due to inadequate resources they were deprived of the
          riches of aeronautics. The Nautz supported their dreams through
          educational programmes, scholarships and sponsoring NASA and ISRO
          visits. Their presence made the digital evolution reach its peak. When
          nautz arrived, they came with so much high technology, rare metals and
          plants.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className='hover:scale-105'>
          From the knowledge and resources they had revolutionized the world
          that we live in, every single person associated with nautz still
          continues to board their ship of dreams. They enlightened people with
          NFTs, which stands for non-fungible tokens. NFT art is a digital
          investment that is collectable, unique, and non-transferrable. Every
          NFT is distinctive in its productive design and cannot be duplicated,
          making them limited, rare, cheap and sustainable. Nautz community
          added perks to all NFT holders, every holder will have so many
          utilities and value addition. A chance to go to NASA academy, train as
          an astronaut and get an opportunity to travel to space.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className='hover:scale-105'>
          Elon tusk propagated simultaneous ways to support nature and the
          community at large. He declared a strategy for every NFT bought: the
          Nautz would plant 5 trees and generate carbon credits by using natural
          energy sources. Such refined ways bloomed the living standards of
          people and the legacy of the Nautz community has continued for decades
          to come. It started 100 years back with 5000 men and with every
          passing year on Earth it has multiplied itself to thousands spread
          across universes helping concrete dynasties to survive themselves
          through sustainability. An empire started by my grandfather, Elon Tusk
          and Nautz is now benefiting lives in various aspects.
